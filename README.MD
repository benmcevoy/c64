Learn some 6502 assembly and progam the C64
==============================================

Last time I wrote 6502 was probably... 1990?

Using kickass assembler in vscode under linux
lib path is `~/c64/_lib` 

I've tried to implement everything myself, except for some of the junk in the `/test` folder.
If I've used someone elses work I've tried to cite it.

I have no idea if this is *idiomatic assembly* but I don't think anyone cares :)
