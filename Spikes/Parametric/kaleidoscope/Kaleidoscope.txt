let a = 22
let b = 0
let c = b
for d = c to a+a*pi*rnd
 let e = pi*pi*rnd
 let b = b + e*rnd
 let c = c+e*rnd
 let b = b && b <= a
 let c = c && c <= a

 plot a+b, a+c
 plot a+b, a-c
 plot a-b, a+c
 plot a-b, a-c

 plot a+c, a+b
 plot a+c, a-b
 plot a-c, a+b
 plot a-c, a-b
next d


my cutdown version

the *pi rubbish does not mean anything
the random numbers are scaled down to fit the screen
 check bounds, either be the value or 0
 let b = b && b <= a --- can just skip to the next iteration if so, as it just draws a dot in the center otherwise 

let a = 22
let b = 0
let c = b
for d = random
 
 let b = random
 let c = random
 let b = b && b <= a
 let c = c && c <= a

 plot a+b, a+c
 plot a+b, a-c
 plot a-b, a+c
 plot a-b, a-c

 plot a+c, a+b
 plot a+c, a-b
 plot a-c, a+b
 plot a-c, a-b
next d
